Last week I did something I have wanted to do for years.

I went on an *everyday adventure*.

Wednesday after work I packed my bag (barely able to fit everything inside it) and biked to a nearby beach forest. I found a secluded spot by the beach and stayed overnight. I experienced the calm evening and a beautiful sunrise next morning. 

And I did all of this on a regular weekday. Back in the office by 8.30 AM.
