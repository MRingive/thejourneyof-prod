My January expense sheet has fewer entries than December and so it must have been a boring month. At least that should be the conclusion if you subscribe to the belief that fun is expensive. But when I look back I don't see boring---I see lots of joy and good memories.

I spent one weekend backpacking, another one coding a new project. One weekend I was at a party with friends, another one I had friends over for dinner. I spent time with family and with myself in deep thought. 

I even spent an entire week working from a beach house. Granted the weather was grey and stormy so not exactly a tropical vacation experience. Quite the opposite---a storm hit Denmark during the weekend I was at the house and more or less kept me inside for two days.

# Results

I saved 64% of my income in January. 

I don't have much to complain about on that account. I did order take-out once but it was after my backpacking journey. 50 km in ~ 24 hours with freezing temperatures at night. So I feel like that was deserved.
