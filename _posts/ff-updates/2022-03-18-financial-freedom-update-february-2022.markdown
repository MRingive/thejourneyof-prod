# Results

I saved 54% of my income in February. Above [my goal of 50%][how-im-getting-started] so that is good.

I have one or two small expenses that I could improve on. But a bigger picture is starting to form. After 4 months of tracking my expenses I am starting to see where the money goes. I don't have a full picture yet. But for now my living situation is clearly the number one culprit.

The Home category has consistently been responsible for more than 50% of my expenses since the start of this journey. I would like to do something about this and I am working on a plan. It will take some time but at least I'm now more aware of this. Which is [why I started tracking my expenses][how-im-getting-started] in the first place. So far it seems to work.
