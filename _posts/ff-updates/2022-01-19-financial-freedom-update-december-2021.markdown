In [my last update][november-ff-update-december] I braced myself for one of the more expensive months---December. But I'm ~~pleasantly~~ surprised to find that it is not that bad (see [Friends and Family](#friends-and-family) below for more about my conflicted feelings).

# Results

I saved 58% of my income in December. And to me that is a great result. It is above my 50% goal and I only have a single expense I feel a slight regret about.


| Category       | Percentage of expenses |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Home           | 56.38%                 |
| Food           | 15.36%                 |
| Gift           | 10.94%                 |
| Personal       | 8.21%                  |
| Union          | 4.01%                  |
| Utilities      | 3.21%                  |
| Transportation | 1.87%                  |
| Other          | 0.04%                  |


The biggest difference between [last month][november-ff-update] and this one is the _Gift_ row. Naturally. Christmas gifts accounted for 11% of my expenses. Personal is also higher this month---twice the size of last month. But most of it is money spent with friends so I have no regrets about that.

Other than that there isn't much to say about the expenses. I had one personal expense that I should have been without but it is a minor one in the big picture and I'm still a complete beginner at this.

# Improving?

In November I took action to cut down my expenses---I purged my subscriptions and used the public library for the first time in many years. This month I didn't do much of that. But I still had a good result. 

I simply didn't buy anything or do anything expensive (except for New Year's).

I have lots of things I can improve. Lots of things I want to improve. But at the core it comes down to what I did this month---don't spend money on things I don't need.

# Friends and Family

I celebrated Christmas with family and New Year's with friends. And when I look back I realize that while I did not have an expensive month, some may have had. I especially think of my parents. We went on a Christmas trip early in December and I paid nothing for that. Same for Christmas.

I feel bad about this.

I know I am lucky to have such great people in my life. But I also know I have never appreciated them or their support as much as I should.

And now that I'm trying to spend less on things I don't need it seems like I have encountered this conflict of other people spending money on me. I hit my goal this month but did I do it at the cost of someone else? Is this path making me even more self-centered?

I'm not sure I have the answer yet. It's easy to dismiss the idea by claiming that money is not important. That friendship and family are above that. But that's just not true. [Relationships are what you invest in them][think-week-2021-relationships]. And if I don't want to invest in mine they will suffer.

For New Year's we had delicious food from a restaurant. And we split the cost. That one is easy. But what about something like a Christmas trip, all expenses paid?

How can I make up for that?

I can maybe accept there is nothing to make up for. Good relationships are built by investing in them but it is not a game. There is no score. You don't look at the numbers and decide who is ahead or behind.

I want to invest more in my relationships. But it shouldn't be because I have to make up for anything---or because I want to get ahead. The only good reason to invest in a relationship is that I want a stronger bond. 

My journey right now is to reduce expenses. So I won't invest by spending more money. In the case of the Christmas trip, I don't think my parents would want that either. I want to make up the difference I feel in another way. I will try to invest a resource more valuable and scarce than money---my time and attention.

# Thinking About Money

When I decided to cut down my excess spending I did not consider complications like these. I expected resistance but I didn't know what form it would take.

Spending less money does complicate some things. But then again, I'm not sure I would have contemplated this relationship/money dynamic had it not been for these monthly reflections. And I'm glad I did. 

Only by being more thoughtful can I start to discover and evolve my relationship with money and understand the implications of that relationship. And I think that is a lesson far overdue.
