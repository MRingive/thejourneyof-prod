A few expenses here and there but overall a fine month.

# Results

I saved 54% of my income in April. Still above target ðŸ™Œ

I paid for a dinner with my family and spend a bit on a weekend with friends. Those expenses are good (although learning how to cook could have saved me quite a bit). But I'm also starting to see myself revert back to some of my habits before this journey.

I have been going for some months now and so the newness has worn off. I'm doing fine but I also want to make sure I do not fall back on old routines.

Hopefully these monthly reportings help me stay accountable. So far they have done a good job.
