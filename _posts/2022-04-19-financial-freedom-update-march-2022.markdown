March 2022 was a very unusual month and so I don't think there is much to learn from the numbers. Instead, the lesson I learned is that life sometimes takes unexpected turns.

# Results

I saved 60% of my income in March. A good result as I expected the savings rate to be much lower. March was _very_ unusual so I think I will just leave it at that and not spend more time analyzing the numbers.

Instead, I'll spend a few minutes contemplating my amazing network of family, friends, and country.

# Serious Illness

At the end of February I was diagnosed with a serious illness. I'm fine now and I have no lasting injuries. But the experience naturally shook me. I had surgery early March and spent most of the month recovering and visiting the hospital for checkups.

Looking back I can only be grateful for the great support my family and friends provided. This post is supposed to be about financials but that was not the support I needed. I'm lucky to be in a position where money was the last thing on my mind and financial support was not something to worry about. Instead I received psychological support that I will forever be grateful for.

Money was never on my mind as I live in Denmark. And that means free state-of-the-art healthcare. This is not something I usually think about (which is wonderful), but when lightning strikes it is a blessing to be taken care of without worrying about bankruptcy or insurance claims.
